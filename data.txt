10) The Brahmin’s dream
A poor Brahmin lived in a village all alone. He had no friends or relatives. He was known for being stingy and he used to beg for a living. The food he got as alms were kept in an earthen pot which was hung beside his bed. This allowed him to easily access the food when he got hungry.  


On one day, he got so much rice gruel that even after completing his meal, there was so much leftover in his pot. That night, he dreamt that his pot was overflowing with rice gruel and that if a famine came, he could sell the food and earn silver from it. This silver could then be used to buy a pair of goats who would soon have kids and create a herd. This herd in turn could be traded for buffaloes who would give milk from which he could make dairy products. These products could be sold in the market for more money.


This money would help him get married to a rich woman and together they would have a son who he could scold and love in equal measure. He dreamt that when his son wouldn’t listen, he would run after him with a stick.
Wrapped up in his dream the Brahmin picked up the stick near his bed and started hitting  the air with the stick. While flailing about, he hit the earthen pot with the stick, the pot broke and all the contents spilled over him. The Brahmin woke up with a start only to realize that everything was a dream.


Moral of the story
One should not build castles in the air.


11) The Stork and the Crab
An old Stork lived on the side of a fish pond. He was too old to fish any longer, and he had to come up with an idea for food. Suddenly, he had a great idea.
He stood in the water with a sad face. A crab came up to him and ask him why he was so unhappy.


The Stork said "I've heard that this pond is going to dry up soon and now I have to fly away to another pond."
Concerned, the crab asked the stork to save the animals in the pond as well.
He would take a couple of fish in his beak and fly away towards another pond. Once he would reach far out of sight the pond, he would eat them. He did this many times.


Now it was the crab’s turn. As they were flying the crab looked down but could not see a pond however he saw a lot of fish bones. The crab immediately realized what was happening and grabbed the stork’s throat tight with his sharp claws. The stork struggled to get free. But the crab held on. Soon the stork fell to the ground. The crab crawled back to his pond to tell the story to the rest of the pond creatures.


Moral of the story
Too much greed is bad for you and will only cause you harm


12) The Blue Jackal Story:
Once there was an adventurous jackal who frequently strayed into the village looking for food. The Village was filled with dogs that scared the jackal. Although he was scared of the dogs, the jackal loved food and travelled to the city again and again.


One day, as he was going to enter a house, he heard barking. He was shocked to find a gang of dogs running towards the house. They looked violent and caused the jackal to panic. He ran and tumbled into a tub of blue dye. The dogs couldn’t see him and they ran another way.


Now the jackal was completely blue from head to toe. He appeared very different from any other animal. The jackal was pleased as no one would be able to recognize him and he could easily fool anyone in the jungle.
Just like he had thought, everyone in the jungle was surprised to see such an unusual animal.


The small animals, the lion and the tiger all asked who he was and who had sent him.
“I have been sent by God himself to look after you. I will now be the king of the jungle” The jackal said.


The lion protested saying he had always been the king of the forest.
“From now, that must change and all of you must serve me” The Jackal happily said.


Some animals like the tiger protested and asked what would happen if they didn’t obey him. He replied saying God would destroy the entire jungle if they didn’t.


Scared for their lives and their jungle, the animals asked the blue Jackal what he would like them to do.
“Bring me lots of food” said the blue jackal promptly.
The animals quickly scurried and returned with lots of food for the Jackal.
He had so much food that he gave his leftovers to the other animals and told them that they had to serve him fresh food every day.
He even threw out the pack of jackals from the forest because he knew that they could identify him some day.


The blue Jackal was very happy with himself for fooling the entire forest and was happy to be away from the city dogs.
But one day the banned pack of jackals was walking around the forest and howling loudly. The blue jackal began howling out of habit too.
Because of this mistake, the other animals quickly identified him as a jackal and destroyed him.


Moral of the story:
Be true to yourself and don’t pretend to be someone you are not

I am glad to have gone through the comment section carefully and with the help of some victims here who had similar cases such as mine.. I made the right decision to contact the R O O T K I TS R E C O V E R Y FIRM. I saw some red flags from some other hackers I checked out before contacting ROOTKITS TEAM for help and assistance, i felt non was knowledgeable and transparent enough, especially the ones who are just after an upfront payment. I love transparency and am glad ROOTKITS RECOVERY FIRM provided that. Good communication and swift delivery. It’s top tier service for me. I recommend to anyone who might need such help. I was recently a victim of this fraudulent activities. I unknowingly invested about 280k GPB with a fake crypto investment platform, after a few weeks of investing with them.. just one morning i woke up and noticed that the company website was down, i tried reaching out but was unable to reach their contact numbers or emails with which we stayed in touch. I assumed they were having some maintenance routing check, as that had happened in the past. but weeks went by and i still didn’t get a help or even a response from them. i didn’t get to hear from them again. At this point i had developed the feelings of been scammed. I was kind of lost as i had lost most of my savings to this platform. it was really depressing for about 2 to 3 months . I was ashamed to tell anyone about it this not even my family. finally i came up with the thought to search for a hacker for some help to retrieve my funds and thats was how i came across the contact details of ROOTKITS RECOVERY FIRM ( r o o t k i t s 4 @ g m a i l . c o m ) a Recovery firm which specializes on recovering back lost cryptocurrency or funds. I contacted them for help and they did guided me through the whole process of recovering back all my lost funds back to the fake company. it was a great feeling to get my money back as i almost gave up.

May I have your attention for a moment? I am eager to share my journey of INVESTMENT RECOVERY with KNIGHTHOODBOT DIGITAL HACK CORP, who played a pivotal role in my success story within the investment domain. Our communication channels included EMAIL: K N I G H T H OO D B O T AT GMAIL DOT COM and Telegram K N I G H T H O OD B O T 9 . Initially, my venture into the crypto field did not unfold as expected. I was led to believe that withdrawals could be made at any time, but these claims turned out to be deceitful tactics employed to entice investors. As I delved deeper into the investment, the scammers resorted to various excuses to reject my withdrawal requests. Beginning with a modest investment of $500, I found myself entrapped in their scheme, eventually pouring in a substantial sum of $98k USDT.
Unfamiliar with the intricacies of cryptocurrency, I sought guidance from a purported expert linked to a family member in the Middle East. Unfortunately, these interactions proved to be part of an elaborate fabrication orchestrated by skilled scammers who preyed on vulnerable individuals like myself. However, thanks to the intervention of KNIGHTHOODBOT DIGITAL HACK CORP, my fortunes took a turn for the better. Their team of proficient hackers meticulously traced my funds to the perpetrators and successfully restored them to my wallet.There exists a prevalent misconception that lost cryptocurrency is irretrievable. Yet, I stand as living proof that this notion is outdated. In recent times, KNIGHTHOODBOT DIGITAL HACK CORP has emerged as a beacon of hope in the realm of digital recovery, armed with the qualifications and expertise necessary to navigate through such challenges. Your decision today shapes your tomorrow; consider reaching out to them if you find yourself entangled in financial turmoil unwittingly.

THE NEED FOR A HACKER & FINDING VALOR HACK RECOVERY TEAM
In my opinion as a financial planner who still got defrauded, I’ll always advice your need to invest if you want to grow wealth. Participating in financial markets is a great way to get your money working for you so you can increase your assets over time.But this path is littered with potential pitfalls that you need to avoid if you want to have a positive outcome in the long run. And for most people, it’s more important to avoid big mistakes than it is to consistently hit home runs.After loosing millions which is around 87 BTC I watched everything I ever worked for flash before my eyes all in the name that I had to pay a tax that I know nothing about to get them out,luckily for me VALOR HACK RECOVERY TEAM intervened in the nick of time. I had to understand the Value of working with “hackers varies by person, while hackers are legally prohibited in today’s world,research suggests that people who work with hackers in an attempt to recover their lost/locked funds in an investment ring feel more at ease about their finance and could end up with about 90%-100% of what they lost. This can only be applied if you can see this right now make your way to VALOR HACK RECOVERY TEAM’s inbox ;

Most “experts” are confused by investing just like you, or if they’re confident, it’s because they’re blind to the humbling reality that the essence of investing is putting capital at risk into an unknowable future. Outcomes are always probabilistic at best because the future will always be unpredictable. Nobody ever truly knows what will happen, including the experts.Only a good recovery firm will let you know this and it’s one of the benefits of VALOR HACK RECOVERY TEAM,”ENLIGHTENMENT”.

A very Massive shoutout to the R O O T K I T S R E C O V E R Y F I R M for their great effort and professional services devoted towards the recovery process of my lost investment. i sincerely appreciate what this team had done for me and I’m here today to let more people know about your good work. I have been a victim of crypto scam and i know how it does really feel to loose your investment especially when you remember that hard work and sleepless night put together, i didn’t know i was dealing with scammers and liars, the whole scenario all began when i had met a colleague over on LinkedIn who introduced me into this Crypto investment platform, where investors are to benefit from the company’s high return profits. she really spoke so good about this platform that i was convinced to partner with the company.. i went on and invested some funds with them without making a proper due diligence over the company’s profile. as time goes on i was told that i can only apply for withdrawal when i must have unlocked the ultimate package.. so i invested more to enable me grow my investment, the devastating part of my story is that i got some loan to enable me invest in this platform in order to make some profit.., this scammers made everything look so real in the way that you won’t ever believe that you’re been ripped off. i finally got due to request for withdraw but whenever i tried doing that the error messages indicates “Declined” i contacted the costumer support for help but i was instructed to pay for the gas fee before the withdrawal can be approved, i did paid for this gas fees but still couldn’t have my funds withdrawn. after all my failed attempts to withdraw my funds i had to quit moving further with the platform and started looking for a possible means to recover my money. Fortunately i came across the email contact R O O T K I T S 4 @ G M A I L . C O M ( ROOTKITS RECOVERY FIRM) on the goggle where people has some good reviews about the team, i contacted them for help and they did put an amazing smile on my face by getting back my lost investment. i so much appreciate their service and i must say they are off expert level on this field.. you can as well contact them through Telegram: @ ROOTKITS7

I got scammed by an online cryptocurrency trading company.. my first ever experience with scam and it was a terrible one for me as I lost everything i had worked for over the years to this fake trading company, i was really devastated and lost.. but special thanks to this Godsend Team “ R O O T K I T S R E C O V E R Y F I R M. for saving my life.. it all started last October 2023 when a lady I had been friends with on Facebook contacted me and offered me with some investment advice.. from her page she looks like a certified crypto trader who also runs a mentorship program, this got me interested as i wanted to know more.. she had offered to guide me and put me down through the whole process so without much deliberation we moved forward, i first started the beginners project with $1500 usd.. it was going well.. I made some upgrade as the lady advised me.. later upgraded to the “millionaires pack where I invested $1.2m usdt, made all transfers with my Binance account without knowing that I was been defrauded.. it then got to the point that i wanted to move some parts of my funds into my bank account.. i noticed that my withdrawal wasn’t approved, i quickly called the attention of the customer care dept for assistance but I was asked to pay some huge fees just so my withdrawals can be processed, i did paid the fees but my funds was still not released.. this was around mid January this year. the lady that was putting me through all this stopped replying to my texts and calls, i then realized that i was been scammed by this platform, Well i reported my case immediately to the authorities but no serious action was taken for a few weeks I had made my report, i then decided to lookout for a good hacking team to help me to recover back my funds from this platform, so grateful i met The ROOTKITS RECOVERY FIRM through the individual reviews of fellow victims who had their funds recovered, I quickly contacted them through their Telegram account; ROOTKITS7 they responded and asked for a few details which i had them provided with before they processed the recovery of my funds, i am so happy and thankful to this professional team for recovering back my funds from the fake platform that defrauded off my investment.. if you have ever been defrauded i advise you reach out to this team for their assistance and services to recover back your funds.

There is a big shift in the understanding that people have of what “dating apps” are for-mostly because they’re called “dating apps”. Modern dating apps are an entertainment product: a gallery of people in your area and someone will occasionally like your photos. Unfortunately some people have decided to make the dating app space unsafe for casual people who simply wishes to use the app for its primary purposes. Nowadays, when you join a dating site, there’s a 99% chance that you’re going meet these people always trying to pitch an app/ company that they claim is a more effective way to save and earn money some even go to the lengths of building a romance relationship with you first before manipulating your feelings towards investing in some sort of financial setup. I had plenty of experience with the likes of these individuals. However I later fell victim to one lady I had met on hinge her name was Tonya, I actually met up with her one time, I never knew that these crypto scammers actually operate in real life as well. She always came up with some sort of excuse whenever I suggested we met up again, I felt I didn’t make a good first impression and tried making up for that by buying into a referral program she dealt with , I invested a total of $340k within 4 months but when I insisted to see her again before going further she stopped responding to me and blocked me on all platforms. I didn’t know what to think or believe but I was sure of one thing, Tonya was a fraud. I quickly started scorching the internet for best possible means to recover sent crypto funds, this led me to a podcast where I learnt about how SWIFT RECOVERY FIRM has recovered stolen/scammed crypto assets for individuals, without further hesitation I messaged the team through their official EMAIL ADDRESS WHICH IS swiftrecoveryservice006@gmail.com and asked for their help, thankfully the team successfully recovered back the 340k worth of USDT assets I sent to the company address after 48 hours and I feel so fortunate to have been able to get the right team otherwise I have no idea what could’ve become of me.

VALOR HACK RECOVERY SERVICE is the best Recovery service I ever came across and Direct experience has taught me each one of these investment mistakes the hard way, and I share them with you here in the hope you can take a less expensive route to the same knowledge.Scams involving fraudsters posing as legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet providers to steal digital assets. Hacks, on the other hand, occur when cybercriminals gain unauthorized access to a crypto exchange or wallet and steal digital assets. Phishing attacks are when fraudsters trick individuals into revealing their private keys or other sensitive information. Additionally, accidentally sending funds to the wrong address is another common scenario where crypto recovery services are needed. Crypto recovery services can assist in tracking down the recipient and returning the funds and this can only be possible by the aid of a Quality Recovery Service “VALOR HACK DIGITAL ASSET RECOVERY TEAM”.
